captured
========

Quick screen capture and sharing for Mac OS X.

_Note: I have switched my efforts to working on a native Mac version of Captured, which is avaliable on the [Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/captured/id414675451?mt=12). I recomend it over the ruby version because it is faster, lighter on system resources, and has a slightly diffrent feature set. The native version is a paid app (only 99¢), and the ruby version will always be free and open source. Thanks, Chris_

Screen Capture Sharing Tool
===========================

<img src="https://github.com/csexton/captured/raw/master/resources/captured.png" align="right" />

I made captured because I wanted to customize and extend screen capture sharing programs, it is really intended for the commandline savvy.

So, I am making some assumptions about the environment that captured runs in. In particular it expects:

 * A decent understanding of installing ruby gems
 * That [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier) is installed

With that said, once things are installed and configured it really is handy.

Install
=======

To install captured:

    $ sudo gem install captured
    $ captured --install

When you install an example config file to ~/.captured.yml, which has a few examples of possible configuration types.

Using Captured
==============

The main use is to upload a screen shot taken using OS X's built in screen capture.

 1. Press ⌘-⇧-4 to capture
 2. Paste the link

Captured can also be used from the command line to easily share files.

 1. Run `captured path/to/file`
 2. Paste the link

Configuration
=============

By default captured uses Imgur as the default host, but you can configure it to upload and share images by other services.

To edit the configuraiton:

    $ open -e ~/.captured.yml

Type: Imgur
-----------
The simple image sharer. The default option.

<pre>
upload:
  type: imgur
</pre>

Type: Imageshack
----------------
This service is a little slower, but is free and easy.

<pre>
upload:
  type: imageshack
</pre>


Type: scp
---------

If you have you own web server scp is a very handy way to host your own captures.

 * user - optional if your remote user is the same as your local user
 * password - optional if you have setup key pair authentication
 * host - the remote host name
 * url - the public url to the remote host+path
 * path - the remote path to upload to

<pre>
upload:
  type: scp
  user: user
  password: secret
  host: example.com
  path: path/to/captured/
  url: "http://example.com/captured/"
</pre>
